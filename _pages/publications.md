## Job Market Paper
Kwong-Yu Wong. (2021). &quot;[Dynamic Competition of Real Estate Developers in Hong Kong: Lesson on Counter-cycle Policy](http://academicpages.github.io/files/paper1.pdf)&quot; 

 * Cyclical, or counter-cyclical, policy tends to be regarded as less disruptive to the market than universal/acyclical policy, but it is less certain when dynamic competition is involved. Utilizing a transaction-level data converted from sales documents, I study the impact of counter-cycle policy by structurally estimating the dynamic competition of the Hong Kong real estate primary market, in comparison with acyclical policy. With the help of satellite images and data regularity, workarounds on data issue can be made. By approximating with Extended Oblivious Equilibrium (EOE) that accommodates market shocks, this competition with many firms drastically reduces the state space from the order of 55 and hence can then be estimated. The counterfactual analysis shows that counter-cycle policy actually introduces an impact bigger than acyclical policy in this market. This calls for caution against a common perception that counter-cycle measures necessarily cause less distortion than a full-scale acyclical measure.
